hey, I'm looking for some advice. I haven't really realized it until nowâ€”but for some reason every time I cry it's on camera. I feel a bit self conscious about it, and I wonder if its getting old for you guys. I rarely cry in my everyday life, so I wonder if it's a way to be vulnerable to people on the internet or something. has anyone experienced anything similar. thanks.

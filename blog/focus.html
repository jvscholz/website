    <h2>the focused life</h2>

UPDATE: defunt blog post. working on a book discussing a similar topic. 4/11/24

<h3> intro </h3>
    <p>
      being part of western gen-z cohort, the societal expectation is to life a
      digital life—to share every experience on instagram, to get news from youtube,
      to entertain ourselves on tiktok, to purchase everything from amazon, to sink
      hours into the latest video game, you get the point. it's how most of us live,
      yet rarely do we reflect upon the consequences of such a lifestyle. further,
      given that our friends and family (and everyone around us) are digitally
      united, we are expected to do the same.
    </p>


    <p>
      often times we act without thinking of consequences. we are slaves to our
      emotional desires. we forgo long-term thinking, and instead choose to
      listen to our emotive taskmasters, constantly chasing the next dopamine
      hit, the next new product, the newest release of x, finding ourself yet
      longing for y, not knowing we needed z. this masochistic cycle is what
      drives the lifestyles of nearly gen-z person. while it's part of human
      nature to desire, it's a problem when these feelings get conflated for
      value. the question then becomes—what brings value? currently, within our
      shallow existences, it's a rare discussion that seems to have been lost
      between generations.
    </p>

    <h3>why</h3>

    <p>
      gen-z, the distracted generation, the vain generation, the connected
      generation, the indulgent generation, this is the generation that will
      soon run society. being part of this generation, I can give an internal
      look, discuss the reasons why my generation is novel, and discuss the
      extrapolations of the consequences of our individual actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      why do we live like this? why are we expected to live like this? how did
      we end up like this?—being a part of the anxious generation, just thinking
      of these questions often spurs anxiety within myself. these are important
      questions. they're difficult to answer, yet we have to try. if we can't
      understand the reasoning behind our behavior, it becomes impossible to
      adjust ourselves for a better life. in my opinion, there's a few reasons
      we've ended up like this.
    </p>

    <h3>value</h3>

    <p>
      chasing value is something humans have done for a <i>long</i> time.
      meaning is something gen-z is lacking. we are comfortable, pampered, and
      don't understand suffering. our lives have been so easy, we are
      uncomfortable with any sort of pain. what's unique about this generation,
      is our unprecedented access to distraction.
    </p>


    <p>
      nihilism is the philosophical basis driving our lifestyles.
      as religion becomes increasingly unpopular, the typical goals that drove our predecessors has been lost (as well as our moral drives).
      because of this, it's difficult to find a guiding light in the current world.
      what should we chase after?—given there is no intrinsic meaning to life anyway (according to nihilism).
    </p>

    <h3>the search—finding a balanced lifestyle</h3>

    <p>
      is it possible to live in the connected world—whilst choosing a focused
      lifestyle? these two seemingly dimorphic lifestyles seem to clash, each
      valuing different ideals differently. should we live like luddites,
      regressing 200 years, choosing atechnology to any technology? conversely,
      we could choose to live as we do, constantly connected, constantly
      stimulated, constantly shallow.
    </p>

    <h3>a wholesome existence</h3>

    <p>the virtuous life is</p>

    <h3>concluding thoughts—who is this for</h3>

3. if you get a inkpalm 5, there's a good chance that you'll have to enable english on it through the command line. there are tutorials on how to do this

<h3>installing apps</h3>
because chinese devices doesn't have google play services, you have to side load apps. UPDATE: you can now root hisense devices to have google play.

    <h3>additional resources</h3>
    I have a post that's tangentially related on how I setup my boox devices, my hisense touch is configured in a similar fashion—https://jvscholz.com/blog/boox.html
</p>

<h3>apps that I use regularly—</h3>
<ul>
    <li>aio launcher: my favorite android launcher</li>
    <li>unlauncher: my second favorite android launcher</li>
    <li>mAbook: fantastic audiobook player, unfortunately you have to install a cracked apk as purchasing the full version requires google play services, UPDATE: you can now install google play on the hisense touch thru root. it works :)</li>
    <li>anki: i enjoy studying japanese and reviewing decks on my android devices</li>
    <li>syncthing: useful for automatically syncing files between my computers and android devices</li>
    <li>tachiyomi: great manga reading app UPDATE: rip tachi :((</li>
    <li>moon+ reader pro: pretty solid android e-reader app. not optimized for e-ink but works well enough. I've also tested koreader, which is optimized for eink, but find the interface displeasing. technically it's a more powerful app, and it's also open source—I should probably switch to koreader. UPDATE: I switched to koreader. way better ++1</li>
    <li>spotify: works as expected, interface is dark but usable</li>
 </ul>

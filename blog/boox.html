   <b>getting the most out of your boox tablet</b>
<p>I've been using my boox tablet for several years now, and given that the devices run android, have found myself keen on customizing them for optimized functionality. here's how I personally use my devices—</p>
<p>1. I've found myself searching for a new launcher on the device. one of the beauties of android is its ability to switch out the launcher—the main desktop environment that your device returns to after closing an app. while the default onyx launcher is perfectly usable, i'm not content with its lack of several "enthusiast" features, such as the ability to hide apps, add widgets, customize visual design, etc. having tested many launchers, i've been the happiest with unlauncher and aio launcher. unlauncher has worked well on my smaller devices, such as my nova air—while aio launcher has worked well on my larger boox note x. note: in order to access the default library and notes app, you'll have to add them as widgets. i'll upload my aio launcher settings, you can find them here:
<p>2. adjusting note taking settings. while boox isn't particularly refined in ux, at least they offer users the ability to adjust many parts of the note taking experience. if you're writing on pdfs, i'd advise changing the page turn area so misclicks are reduced. this can be done in neoreader by clicking on the top right > settings > touch settings > mode 6. because I usually take notes on pdfs, I typically don't use the default notes app. because of this, I don't have any optimizations to recommend.</p>
<p>3. switching out the stock pen. i'm a bit of a snob when it comes to writing utensils. i've been pampered with high-end stationery for several years now, and often found myself fed up with the stock onyx pen. the plastic feels cheap, and it lacks an eraser. I generally reach for the tab s6 lite s-pen because it has a nice writing feel, is well built, and has a side eraser button. side note: I have a strong preference for side erasers vs traditional erasers at the back of the pen. i've been meaning to test the kaweco safari emr, tragically it doesn't have an eraser so i've been reluctant to spend so much on a less featured device. </p>
<p>4. in the onyx settings, change the wifi disable settings by going to settings > power > delay wifi, bluetooth, and audio disconnection after into sleep mode > however long you choose. I personally use 5 minutes </p>
<p>here's a list of apps that I find myself using on my boox devices—
<ul>
   <li>einkbro: great browser designed for e-ink</li>
   <li>pocket: great for saving articles for later reading. works well as I'm also a firefox user</li>
   <li>anki: i enjoy studying japanese and reviewing decks on my boox devices</li>
   <li>syncthing: useful for automatically syncing files between my computers and tablets</li>
   <li>tachiyomi: great manga reading app</li>
   <li>neoreader: i've tested neoreader, alreader x, moon+ reader pro, koreader—and have found myself enjoying neoreader the most. the floating dictionary works well, it's easy to change book covers, and you can sync progress between other boox devices</li>
   <li>solid explorer: allows you to add folders as a shortcut on your homescreen. i personally have a folder for textbooks and school notes, this allows easy access</li>
</ul>

    <h2>review a japanese dumbphone (903kc)</h2>

    <h3>intro</h3>

    <p>
      <i
        >hey, if you're wondering why someone might be inclined to live with a
        dumbphone, checkout this post that I wrote.</i

    </p>

    <p>
      finding a dumbphone that works with local carriers, one that isn't a test
      of masochism to use, and one that maintains a "wholesome" feature set, is
      such a challenge to find that you'd have a better chance understanding
      Ulysses after a single pass—yet, I think my quest is finally finished.
    </p>

    <p>
      having been part of the dumbphone community for several years now (yes, it
      exists)—and having tested dozens of dumbphones, the 903kc has been the
      best dumbphone I've tested. it maintains a special set of features that
      allow it to conform well with the <i>digital minimalism</i> lifestyle.

    <h3>existing phones, and why this one is different</h3>

    <h3>how I use dumbphones</h3>

    <h3>conclusion, and recommendations</h3>

    <p>
      recommending the focused lifestyle in general is difficult, choosing to
      life a life disconnected can feel isolating, and explaining your choices
      to others is often an undertaking in itself. further, recommending any
      dumbphone is difficult—they can be buggy, often don't work well globally,
      and are occasionally difficult to track down. with that, I'll do my best
      to recommend a phone for those looking.

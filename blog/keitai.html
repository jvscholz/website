<h2>review a japanese dumbphone (903kc)</h2>

<h3>intro</h3>

<p><i>hey, if you're wondering why someone might be inclined to live with a dumbphone, checkout this post that I wrote.</i></p>

<p>finding a dumbphone that works with local carriers, one that isn't a test of masochism to use, and one that maintains a "wholesome" feature set, is such a challenge to find that you'd have a better chance understanding Ulysses after a single pass—yet, I think my quest is finally finished. </p>

<p>having been part of the dumbphone community for several years now (yes, it exists)—and having tested dozens of dumbphones, the 903kc has been the best dumbphone I've tested. it maintains a special set of features that allow it to conform well with the <i>digital minimalism</i> lifestyle.</p>

<p>choosing a phone that balances useful features, </p>

<h3>how I use dumbphones</h3>

<h3>conclusion, and recommendations</h3>

<p>recommending the focused lifestyle in general is difficult, choosing to life a life disconnected can feel isolating, and explaining your choices to others is often an undertaking in itself. further, recommending any dumbphone is difficult—they can be buggy, often don't work well globally, and are occasionally difficult to track down. with that, I'll do my best to recommend a phone for those looking.</p>

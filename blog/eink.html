<b> e-ink devices <b>
		<p>
      this post is based off a previous reddit post: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/zzrhbh/eink_lyfe_v2/">https://old.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/zzrhbh/eink_lyfe_v2/</a>

			the idea behind this article is to explain the e-ink devices that I'm currently using, and the journey it took to arrive to those specific devices. here's the current rotationâ€”
			<ul>
				<li>boox note x</li>
				<li>boox nova air</li>
				<li>boox leaf2</li>
				<li>hisense touch</li>
			</ul>
			
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3> boox note x </h3>
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3> boox nova air </h3>
		</p>

		<p>
			<h3> boox leaf2 </h3>
			this device was purchased with the intention of acting as a dedicated e-reader that lived within my bedroom. as I don't allow myself to bring the smartphone into the room, finding a way to keep myself entertained while relaxing in the room is outsourced to the e-reader. this is done with the hope that intentional leisure will occur.

			<h3> hisense touch </h3>
